## User Management Module

The user management module is a crucial component of our ecommerce website, ensuring secure access, managing user accounts, and facilitating effective communication with users. Let's explore the key features of this module:

### Authentication and Authorization

To provide a secure environment, we have implemented user authentication and authorization using **Spring Security**. Users are required to register an account and log in before accessing restricted areas of the website. Spring Security handles password hashing, session management, and user role-based access control. By enforcing security measures, we protect user data and safeguard the website from unauthorized access.

### Account Verification Emails

To ensure that user accounts are valid and active, we have integrated **Spring Mailer** to send account verification emails. Upon registration, users receive an email containing a unique verification link. Clicking on this link confirms their email address and activates their account. This process helps maintain a reliable user base and minimizes the presence of spam accounts.

### Integrated Mailbox

Our user management module includes an integrated mailbox, allowing users to send and receive messages within the website. This feature enables seamless communication between users and provides a centralized platform for inquiries, order updates, and customer support. The mailbox supports various functionalities such as message filtering, searching, and marking messages as read/unread.

### User Ban and Unban

As administrators, we have the ability to manage user behavior by implementing a user ban and unban system. This feature allows us to temporarily restrict access for users who violate our website policies or engage in inappropriate behavior. When a user is banned, they receive a notification and are prevented from logging in until the ban is lifted. This capability ensures a safe and respectful community for all users.

### Newsletter Subscription

We offer a newsletter subscription feature to keep users informed about the latest updates, promotions, and product launches. Users can opt-in to receive newsletters during the registration process or by managing their preferences in their account settings. This feature helps us engage with our user base and increase customer retention.

### QR Code Scanning

To enhance user experience and provide additional functionality, we have integrated QR code scanning into our ecommerce website. Users can scan QR codes using their device's camera, allowing them to quickly access product details, discounts, or exclusive content associated with the scanned QR code. This feature adds convenience and interactivity to the shopping experience.

## Conclusion

The user management module plays a crucial role in our ecommerce website, ensuring secure user access, streamlined communication, and efficient management of user accounts. By leveraging Spring Boot, we have developed a powerful and feature-rich platform that enables seamless online shopping. With the implementation of Spring Security, Spring Mailer, an integrated mailbox, user ban/unban system, newsletter subscriptions, and QR code scanning, we provide a comprehensive solution for managing user interactions and delivering an exceptional shopping experience.
